Data Types and Variables:
1.What are the different data types used in JavaScript variables in the provided code?


2.Explain the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript.
     Const is used to create a variable whos value cannot be changed,let is used for variables that can be redeclaired and var is an old way of declaring variables.


3.Why does JavaScript allow assigning different data types to the same variable?
     This is because a variable acts as a storage for a specified datatype either a string,number ,boolean ,bigInt where the help to manage and manipulate this data


4.How does JavaScript handle variables declared but not initialized? Illustrate with an example from the code.
     When a variable is declared in JavaScript but not initialized Javascript always outputs undefined.
         let declared;
         console.log(declared); 


5.Discuss the significance of variable names in programming and how they are used in JavaScript.
     Variable names are used to Identify and reference values ina a code.
         const myName="Joy Elizabeth Muthoni Kiboi";
         console.log(`My name is ${myName}`);



Numeric Data Types:
6.What are the various numeric data types used in JavaScript, as shown in the code?


7.Explain the difference between integers, doubles, and Infinity in JavaScript with examples.
     Infinity represents a number larger than any finite number eg 3/0 ,integers are numeric value without any decimal eg 2345 and double are numerical values that allow decimals 3.14 especially 64bit.
         //infinite
         let num1=3/0;
         console.log(3/0)
         //integer value
         let num2=50
         console.log(num2)
         //double value
         let num3=345.689
         console.log(num3)

8.How does JavaScript handle arithmetic operations involving different numeric data types?
     Arithmetic operations include -,+,/,%,++.--
     When handling arithmetic operations javascript output depends on input data types eg.
         console.log(2+2) //Output is 4
         console.log("2"+"2") //Output is 22
         console.log("Joy"+34) //Output is Joy34


String Data Type:
9.How are strings represented in JavaScript?
     They are represented using single or double quotes 
         let str ="Hi my name is Joy"
         console.log(str)


10.Discuss the difference between declaring strings with single quotes ('') and double quotes ("") in JavaScript.


11.Explain why characters are automatically treated as strings in JavaScript.


Boolean and Undefined Data Types:
12.Explain the purpose of boolean variables in JavaScript.
Booloan has 2 possible values :True and False and it is useful for decision making and flow control in the program.


13.Discuss the concept of undefined in JavaScript variables and provide examples from the code.
undefined varianle indicates that the variable has beeen defined but not assigned a value.


14.How are boolean variables useful in conditional statements and control flow in JavaScript?
      Booleans control the program flow using consitionals
           let isloggedIn = true;
           if (isloggedIn){
                console.log("Log In Successfully);
           }else{
                console.log("Please enter valid credentials");
           }




Null Data Type:
15.Describe the significance of the null value in JavaScript.
   It is used to indicate that a variable is intentionally empty

16.Differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript.
   null is assigned no value while undefined is declared but not initialized

17.Provide an example from the code illustrating the use of null.
   let user = null; 



Object Data Type:
18.Explain how objects are represented in JavaScript.
   Objects are collections of key-value pairs

19.Discuss the structure and purpose of the countryInfo object in the provided code.


20.How can objects be nested within other objects in JavaScript?
   const student={
      id:123456;
      name:{
      firstname:"JoyElizabeth"
      lastname:"Kiboi"
      }}



Array Data Type:
21.Describe the purpose and structure of arrays in JavaScript.
     They are used to hold different dataTypes
     let me=["Joy",22,"Dkut"]

22.Provide examples from the code demonstrating arrays containing different data types.
     let me=["Joy",22,"Dkut"]

23.Discuss the concept of "array of arrays" and its significance.
     let matrix = [
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6]
     ];




Variable Naming Conventions:
24.What are the conventions for naming variables in JavaScript?
     Start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.

25.Discuss the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names.
     make code easier to understand and maintain.

26.Identify any variable naming conventions followed or violated in the provided code.



Constants in JavaScript:
27.Explain the use of const keyword in JavaScript.
     Declares variables whose values cannot be reassigned.

28.Discuss why reassigning a value to a constant variable results in an error.
     ensures the value remains constant(They are use dwhen a value cannot be changed

29.Provide examples from the code demonstrating the declaration and use of constants.
     const pi = 3.14; 
     console.log(pi)
