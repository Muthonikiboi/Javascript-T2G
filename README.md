# ðŸ“š JavaScript Assignments and Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript assignments and projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of tasks and mini-projects showcasing my work with JavaScript. This includes building a mini testing framework, various string manipulation functions, understanding JavaScript data types, and implementing a simple JSON server.

## ðŸ“‹ Assignments

### Assignment 1: Mini Testing Framework

Create a simplified version of a testing framework similar to Jest using vanilla JavaScript. This includes:

- **Test Runner**: Implement a `TestRunner` class with methods like `registerTest`, `runTests`, `filterTests`, and `setExecutionOrder`.
- **Assertions**: Create assertion functions such as `assertEqual`, `assertNotEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, and `assertContains`.
- **Test Case Definition**: Define tests with descriptive names, group them into suites using `describe`, and add tags.
- **Reporting**: Implement a reporting mechanism to output test results, including details about passed and failed tests.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling and informative error messages.
- **Extensibility**: Design the framework to be extensible with custom assertions and reporters.

### Assignment 2: String Manipulation

Implement functions to handle various string operations:

- Check if a string is a palindrome
- Reverse a string
- Find the longest word in a string
- Check if a string is an anagram
- Remove duplicate characters from a string
- Count palindromes in a string
- Find the longest common prefix
- Case-insensitive palindrome check

### Assignment 3: Understanding JavaScript Data Types

Explore and explain JavaScript data types and variable handling:

- **Data Types**: Different data types used in JavaScript.
- **Variable Declarations**: Differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- **Initialization**: Handling variables declared but not initialized.
- **Numeric Data Types**: Integers, doubles, and `Infinity`.
- **String Data Type**: String representation and differences in quoting.
- **Boolean and Undefined**: Purpose of boolean variables and the concept of `undefined`.
- **Null Data Type**: Significance of `null` and its difference from `undefined`.
- **Object Data Type**: Structure and usage of objects, including nesting.
- **Array Data Type**: Purpose and structure of arrays, including "array of arrays".
- **Variable Naming Conventions**: Importance of descriptive names.
- **Constants**: Usage of `const` and its immutability.

### Assignment 4: Simple JSON Server

Implement a simple JSON server using the following product data:

```
const products = [
    {
      id: "001",
      name: "Wireless Mouse",
      description: "A high-precision wireless mouse with adjustable DPI settings.",
      price: 29.99,
      category: "Electronics",
      stock: 150
    },
    {
      id: "002",
      name: "Bluetooth Headphones",
      description: "Over-ear Bluetooth headphones with noise cancellation.",
      price: 89.99,
      category: "Electronics",
      stock: 75
    },
    {
      id: "003",
      name: "Ergonomic Office Chair",
      description: "An ergonomic office chair with adjustable height and lumbar support.",
      price: 199.99,
      category: "Furniture",
      stock: 20
    },
    {
      id: "004",
      name: "Yoga Mat",
      description: "A non-slip yoga mat with extra cushioning for comfort.",
      price: 24.99,
      category: "Fitness",
      stock: 100
    },
    {
      id: "005",
      name: "Stainless Steel Water Bottle",
      description: "A durable stainless steel water bottle with a leak-proof cap.",
      price: 15.99,
      category: "Home & Kitchen",
      stock: 200
    }
];


```
